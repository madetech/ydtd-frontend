# YDTD Frontend Components

Frontend components for [YDTD](http://www.yourdaytheirday.com). A mixture of
Coffeescript, SASS and HTML partials which are used within the main application.
Created using middleman, imported into Rails as a gem.

## Integrating with a rails app

`YdtdFrontend::Engine` isn't currently hosted on rubygems. To install using
bundler you can include the git repository in your `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'ydtd_frontend', :git => 'https://github.com/madebymade/ydtd-frontend.git',
                     :tag => 'v0.0.9'
```

All the files within `app`, `lib` and `vendor` will now be included in your 
rails application.

## Developing

To view the styleguide or to develop new styles you can run the middleman app.
Run the following to boot it:

``` sh
bundle exec middleman -p 5000
```
