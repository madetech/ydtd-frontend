  YDTD is launching
<% end %>

<% intro do %>
Even though you haven’t had much of a chance to try YDTD during the preview release, we wanted to send you a quick one-time update to let you know about the launch and how it will affect you.
<% end %>

<% para do %>
The preview release was a great success. There are now over 18,000 people around the world using YDTD every single day. Over 3 million messages will be sent in YDTD this week. We’re growing at 10-20% each week, every week. And now, YDTD is ready to launch to the world.
<% end %>

<% para do %>
Because you were in the preview release, we’vce added £250 credits to your team to get started with YDTD. We also have details about our new Give £100, Get £100 referral program and much more. So please check out our handy launch announcement page:
